# MOGSLib-libgomp-benchmark

This repository is built with the intent to compare the default loop schedulers and the binLPT proposed in https://github.com/lapesd/libgomp with the schedulers in MOGSLib.

This repository is also based on https://github.com/lapesd/libgomp-benchmarks but it contains a different version of libgomp, different compilation steps, comparisons and functions to fit the aforementioned purpose.
